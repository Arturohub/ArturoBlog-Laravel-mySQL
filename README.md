My first Laravel + mySQL + Blaze + Tailwind project!

It is a Blog with authentication where I am the admin and I can write my own blog posts. The users can comment my posts. In the future, I plan to implement:

    -A Like system
    -A comment's reply system
    -Recommended posts based on category
    -Other stuff

I did not deploy it because I could not find any free hosting for my Laravel Project (if you know one, let me know!)

I find Laravel and its MVC architecture to be quite easy to understand and to program (much easier than Express, to be honest). Blaze, however, is still way behind React, especially in terms of frameworks like toast, sweet alert and other fancy stuff that make React much more customizable.

The journey continues...
